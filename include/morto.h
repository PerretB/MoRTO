	/**
	* \brief Performs a least square monotonic / isotonic regression with respect to a tree ordering.
	* 
	* \param parents Parent relation between nodes.
	* The indexing of the nodes are assumed to be in topological order (e.g. nodes indices correspond to a post-order traversal of tree).
	* Note that there may be several roots (i.e. the ordering is a forest)
	* Preconditions :
	*		\li parents.size() > 0
	*		\li for all i 0<=parents[i]<parents.size()
	*		\li "node i is the parent of node j" <=> parents[j] == i
	*		\li "node i is the root" <=> parents[i] == i
	*		\li nodes are in topological order : parents[i] >= i
	* \param values Input data associated to nodes.
	* The observed value at node i is values[i].
	* Preconditions :
	*		\li values.size() == parents.size()
	* \param weights Weights associated to nodes.
	* If weights.size() == 0 , every node is assumed to have the same weight.
	* Else, the weight of node i is weights[i].
	* Preconditions :
	*		\li weights.size() == parents.size() || weights.empty()
	 *		\li for all i weights[i]>0
	* \return vector<double> results containing the isotonic regression values for each node.
	* The regression value at node i is result[i].
	* Postconditions :
	*		\li results.size() == parents.size()
	*		\li for all i, results[i] <= results[parents[i]]
	*
	* The isotonic / monotonic regression solves the following problem:
	*	result = argmin_x sum_i (weights[i] * (values[i]-x[i])Â²)
	*		s.t. for all i, x[i] <= x[parent[i]]
	*
	* The algorithm runs in O(n*log(n)) with n the number of nodes (size of the parents vector).
	* The algorithm is an implementation of:

	*		
	* Example:
	* Given the	following tree where each node is a triplet (node index, node value, node weight).

	*	(0,13,1)  (1,14,1)    (2,6,1) (3,8,1)
	*
	* 
	* The inputs of the method should be:
	*  \li parents = {4, 4, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7}
	*  \li values = {13, 14, 6, 8, 11, 7, 2, 10}
	*  \li weights = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} or {}
	* The expected output is {12, 12, 6, 6.5, 12, 7, 6.5, 12}
